Kafka has High Through put , But Low storage 
Database has low throughput , but has high storage 
Also we can't perform query operation in kafka 


Kafka is not an alternative of Database 

Kafka solve the through put problem and database solve the storage problem 
 
So producer produce the data and push inside kafka service 
and those service need data to perform any operation we called as consumer and 
Consumer access data from kafka , 
and after processing they can perform bulk insert in database 

--------------------  Architecture of Kafka -----------------------

1 Consumer can consume multiple partitions 
But 1 partitions is consume by only one consumer 
Let's say there is there is two partition A and B if consumer 1 access partion A so for sure consumer 2 can be access partioin A , it can access partition B but not A 

And this partition consumer things work in group level 


-------------------------- Kafka follow which System -----------------------

RabbitMQ follow Queue architecture ( one partition can only be access by one consumer )
SQS -> Simple Queue Service follow Queue Architecture ( one partition can only be access by one consumer )
But SES -> Simple Email Service follow pub-sub model (means one partition can be access by multiple consumer )

************
But in Kafka 
we can perform both model (queue and pub-sub ) with the help of consumer group
